_Presentation card built with GImage - [View code example](https://joseluisq.github.io/gimage/examples/creating-a-presentation-card/)_

## Features

__GImage__ is a simple and small library based on [PHP Image Processing and GD](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) for processing images without stress.

- Load an image from local path, URL or image resource.
- Create shapes such as rectangles or ellipses with opacity.
- Resize, scale or crop images proportionally.
- Rotate images, shapes or texts.
- Embed text with custom TTF fonts.
- Compose a pool of images with `Canvas`.
- Swap image formats such as JPEG, PNG or GIF.
- Save images in local or output on the browser.
- Save several copies of the same image.
- Render an image in-memory and return the resource.

## Requirements
GImage requires **[PHP 7.x](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php)** and latest [GD Extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php).

## Install

```sh
composer require joseluisq/gimage
```

## Usage

Load an external PNG image and save it as JPG:

```php
<?php

use GImage\Image;

// PNG image (600x199)
$url = 'https://i.imgur.com/G5MR088.png';

$arch = new Image();
$arch
    // Load from URL
    ->load($url)
    // Scale to 50% (300x99)
    ->scale(0.5)
    // Change the format to JPG
    ->toJPG()
    // Saving in local path
    ->save('arch.jpg');
```
